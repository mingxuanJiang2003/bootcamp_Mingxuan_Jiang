# Report — Stage 10a

## 1. Baseline metrics
- R² (train/test):
- RMSE (train/test):
- Coefficients (signs/magnitudes): brief interpretation.

## 2. Diagnostics
- Residuals vs Fitted — linearity/specification: (pattern?)
- Homoscedasticity: (roughly constant spread?)
- Normality (hist + QQ): (roughly normal?)
- Independence (lag-1): (near zero?)

## 3. Optional transformation
- What term was added (e.g., x1²)? Why is it still linear regression (linear in coefficients)?
- Did metrics/diagnostics improve? Keep it or not?

## 4. Conclusion
- Do you trust the model for the task (explain vs predict)?
- Communicate R² and RMSE in context.
- Next steps.
