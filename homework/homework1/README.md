# Project Title
Daily Stock Market Volatility Prediction  
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Short-term volatility in the stock market significantly impacts portfolio risk management. Sudden spikes in volatility can cause substantial portfolio drawdowns, forcing managers to rebalance quickly. Current models often fail to adapt to rapid market regime changes.  

This project aims to develop a predictive model that provides daily volatility forecasts to improve risk-adjusted returns and help managers make timely portfolio adjustments.

## Stakeholder & User
**Primary stakeholders:** Portfolio managers and risk management teams in investment firms.  
**End users:** Analysts and automated trading systems that need daily volatility inputs.  
The forecasts will be integrated into the morning risk report before market open.

## Useful Answer & Decision
Predictive; daily volatility forecast as a numeric metric (annualized %).  
**Decision:** Adjust portfolio leverage, hedge ratios, and asset allocation.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Historical price and volume data available via APIs.
- Forecast latency under 1 hour.
- Compliance with firm¡¯s data privacy policies.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Data quality during extreme events.
- Model performance in regime shifts.
- API downtime or delayed data feeds.
