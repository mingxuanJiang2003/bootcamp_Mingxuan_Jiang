# Stakeholder Memo

## To: Portfolio Managers
## From: Data Science Team
## Subject: Daily Volatility Forecasting Tool

We are developing a predictive model to estimate daily stock market volatility before markets open. 
This tool is designed to improve decision-making by enabling proactive risk management, 
adjusting position sizing, hedging strategies, and capital allocation.

### Why It Matters
Sudden volatility spikes can erode portfolio returns if left unmanaged. 
With accurate daily forecasts, managers can reduce downside risk and improve expected returns.

### Next Steps
- Collect and preprocess daily financial data (S&P 500, VIX, interest rates, etc.).
- Train and evaluate predictive models for short-term volatility.
- Deliver forecasts integrated into existing portfolio workflows.
