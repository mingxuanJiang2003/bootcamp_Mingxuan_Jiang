# Stock Market Volatility Prediction

## Project Summary
We aim to forecast daily stock market volatility to support portfolio managers in risk management and capital allocation. 
Volatility captures the uncertainty in returns; unexpected spikes can create significant losses if unhedged. 
A predictive model that estimates daily volatility before market open allows managers to adjust positions, hedges, and trading strategies proactively, improving portfolio resilience and expected returns.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary User**: Portfolio Managers at investment funds
- **Needs**: Reliable short-term volatility forecasts to adjust position sizing, hedge exposures, and manage risk intraday.
- **Pain Points**: Market noise, sudden regime shifts, macroeconomic events make volatility hard to anticipate.
- **Success Metrics**: Forecast accuracy compared to realized volatility; ability to reduce drawdowns during volatility spikes.
